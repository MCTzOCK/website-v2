CodeUp is a integrated platform which allows beginners to learn the basics of programming.
I made CodeUp for the german competition "Jugend Forscht" and won the first place in the regional competition of the Münsterland.
It was an amazing experience and I got the opportunity to meet a lot of amazing people.
I am now focussing on the implementation of new features for the landwide competition.
